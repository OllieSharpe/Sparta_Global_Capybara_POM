# Sparta_Global_Capybara_POM

This repo contains an automated UI tests for the BBC sign-in page. The tests cover the possible error message outputs for incorrect password and username combinations. IT also tests a successful signup. Selenium is used to automate the browser and RSpec is used to run the tests. The selenium driver is accessed through Capybara to simplify the writing of the tests.
